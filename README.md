# Jenkins Installation

This script automates the installation of Jenkins on a Debian-based system.

## Usage

Clone the repository and execute the installation script:

## Clone the repository

```
git clone https://github.com/RajeevThapa/Install_Jenkins
```

## Navigate to the cloned directory

```
cd Install_Jenkins
```

## Run the installation script (with root privileges)

```
bash install_jenkins.sh 
        or
